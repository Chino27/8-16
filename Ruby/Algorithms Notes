Competencies

Algorithms typically use iterators to manipulate data a certain way
We already work with algorithms in Ruby, they’re called class methods. Built-in methods for strings, arrays, integers, etc out of the box to change them in some way, we’re just now making new ones, custom ones
Algorithms are some of the most common technical interview questions, there is almost always more than one way to solve an algorithm, so it’s a good way for employers to see how you think
You can make your own algorithms through conditionals, loops, and iterators, as well as built-in methods
Some solutions will run faster than others, due to time complexity, we won’t get too deep into that, but a general rule of thumb is that loops and nested loops are slower, and that hashes are faster than arrays




Applications
Make own algorithms for yourself, your current project, future projects
Understand that there are different ways to solve algorithms, and there are “better” ways
